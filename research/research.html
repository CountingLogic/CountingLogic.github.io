			<!-- My PhD thesis <a href="https://iris.unitn.it/handle/11572/382709">On Tractability and Consistency of Probabilistic Inference in Relational Domains</a>.  -->
			I am interested in probabilistic models over relational structures. I have worked in settings, where the relational structures are defined in a first-order logic language. In such a setting, 
			the probabilistic inference task reduces to <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1505">weighted model counting </a>of a first-order logic formula. This
			is intractable in general. Hence, my work has focused on identifying tractable fragments of first order logic, where model counting can be performed in polynomial time. I am particularly interested in analytical approaches to weighted model counting</a>, which yield closed form formulae. My first research contribution has been identifying <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05992">closed form formulae for model counting</a> in First Order Logic with two variables and it's extensions with counting quantifiers. 

			<p>More recently, we extended the aforementioned fragment with graph-theoretic constraints. We allow relations in the language to represent <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11738.pdf">directed acyclic graphs, trees, forests or connected graphs </a>. We show that weighted model counting remains tractable with these additional constraints.

		<P> <b>Consistency and Generalization of Probabilistic Inference in Relational Domains</b><BR> 
		The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3054" >problem</a> originates from the works of Shalizi and Rinaldo in Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs). And was generalized to probabilistic logic setting by <a href = https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00564> Jaeger and Schulte</a>. I with Luciano Serafini, have produced some <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04009">results</a> on this problem in Markov Logic Networks.
		</P>
		<p>
			However, projective models although theoretically interesting, do not model many important properties of the real-world e.g. sparsity, small-world phenomenon etc. So I am trying to understand if some notion of generalization can be formalized to learn non-projective models, that perform relatively well when transferred to domains of different sizes.

				These are the topics I have dabbled in but could not make headway. I hope to go back to (at least some of) them soon: Approximate Weighted Model Counting with guarantees, a  minimum description length based approach to probabilistic inductive logic programming akin to <a href ="https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/0358.pdf">this</a> and defining the notion of <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphon>Graphon</a> and estimating it in the probabilistic logic setting.
