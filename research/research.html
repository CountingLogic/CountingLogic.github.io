		<P><b>Tractable Probabilistic Inference in Relational Domains</b> <BR>
			I am interested in probabilistic models over relational structures. I have worked in settings, where the relational structures are defined in a first-order logic language. In such a setting, 
			the probabilistic inference task reduces to <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1505">weighted model counting </a>of a first-order logic formula. This
			is intractable in general. Hence, my work has focused on identifying tractable fragments of first order logic, where model counting can be performed in polynomial time. I am particularly interested in analytical approaches to weighted model counting</a>, which yield closed form formulae. My first research contribution has been identifying <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05992">closed form formulae for model counting</a> in First Order Logic with two variables and it's extensions with counting quantifiers. I am still diving into more literature on this, but it seems quite hard to expand the fragments of logic that admit tractable model counting. 
		</P>
		<P> <b>Consistent Probabilistic Inference in Relational Domains</b><BR> 
			Recently, I have been interested in consistency of probabilistic inference. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3054" >problem</a> originates from the works of Shalizi and Rinaldo in Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs). And was generalized to probabilistic logic setting by <a href = https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00564> Jaeger and Schulte</a>. I with Luciano Serafini, have produced some <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04009">results</a> on this problem in Markov Logic Networks. 
		</P>
		<P>	
		I am currently working on creating realizable projective models as characterized  by <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10984">Jaeger and Schulte</a>. In their work, they completely characterize the set of projective models over relational vocabularies in terms of AHK models. But as they address in the paper, their description can not be easily mapped to a probabilistic logic framework. 
		</P>

			<b>Future Interests</b><BR>
				These are the topics I have dabbled in but could not make headway. I hope to go back to (at least some of) them soon: Approximate Weighted Model Counting with guarantees, a  minimum description length based approach to probabilistic inductive logic programming akin to <a href ="https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/0358.pdf">this</a> and defining the notion of <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphon>Graphon</a> and estimating it in the probabilistic logic setting.
