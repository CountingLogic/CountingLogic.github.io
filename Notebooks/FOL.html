		<p>Some important ideas from Lectures on <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCEAFjjTJyU&list=PL2cqwPeM9PtMqpoeaD5oV2cSIpn5dhJI3">"Logic for Computer Science"</a> by David Ben Shai.</p>
		<h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Inductively defined Sets (Lecture 2)</h3>
			<b>Defintion 1.</b> Given a set $A$ (core set) in a universe $X$ and a set of functions $P$ of arbitrary arities over $X$. Then  $I(A,P)$ is defined as the minimal set (w.r.t inclusion) that contains the core set $A$ and is closed under $P$.</p>
		<p>
		<b>Defintion 2.</b> Given a set $A$ (core set) in a universe $X$ and a set of functions $P$ of arbitrary arities over $X$. Then  $I(A,P)$ is defined as:
		
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq: IAP}
		\bigcap_{i}\{B  | A \subseteq B \text{ and } B \text{ is closed under P }\}
		\end{equation}
		We wish to prove the equivalence of these definitions i.e. <BR>
			<center><b>Defintion 1.</b> $\leftrightarrow$ <b>Defintion 2.</b></center>
	</p>
	<p><i>Note that the minimality of $I(A,P)$ in the second definition is not completely trivial. Minimality w.r.t inclusion also leads to uniqueness. </i> 
	</p>
	<h3 style="font-weight: normal;">An Auxiliary Result (Lecture 2) </h3>
	Let us have a collection of sets $\{B_i\}_i$. Then for every $B_k \in \{B_i\}_i$ :
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: subset}
	\bigcap_{i}\{B_i\} \subset B_k 
	\end{equation}

	<h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Structural Induction  (Lecture 2)</h3>
	Given an $I(A,P)$ and given a property $H$, our goal is to show that all members of $I(A,P)$ have the property $H$. A property is essentially a subset of $X$, hence, it is enough to show that $I(A,P) \subseteq H$. 
	<P>
	<li> Base Case: Show that $A \subseteq H$
	<li> Induction Step: Show that $H$ is closed under $P$</li>
	</P>
	<P>
	After the above steps, we have shown that $H$ is one of the $B$ in equation \ref{eq: IAP}. Using equation \ref{eq: subset}, we have that $I(A,P)\subseteq H$. Hence, Completing the proof.

	<h3>Construction Sequence (Lecture 2)</h3>
	<b>Defintion 3</b>. A <i>Construction Sequence</i> for a given $\alpha \in I(A,P)$ is the sequence $CS = \{\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n\}$, where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for every $\alpha_i \in CS$, one of the following is true:
	<li> $\alpha_i \in A $
	<li> $\alpha_i = f(\alpha_{j_1},\dots,\alpha_{j_s})$, where $j_{q}$ are smaller than $i$ and $f \in P$.

	<P>
		A proof is a special type of construction sequence. 
	</P>
	<b>Claim:</b> For every valid expression $\alpha$, $\alpha \in I(A,P)$ if and only if there exists a $CS$ for $\alpha$.

	<h3>Showing that $\alpha \not \in I(A,P)$ (Lecture 2)</h3>
	Key Idea: Identify syntactical properties $T$ (equivalently subsets of $X$) such that if $\alpha \in T \rightarrow \alpha \in I(A,P)$. Equivalently, identify 
	$T$ such that $I(A,P) \subseteq T$. For showing that $I(A,P) \subseteq T$ use structural induction.  

	<h3> Showing that $\alpha \not \in I(A,P)$ for Propositional Logic (Lecture 3)</h3> 
	Key Ideas:
	<li> Identify $T$ syntactically  such that it contains $A$ and is closed under $P$. Clearly, $T$ is a super set of $I(A,P)$ by definition.
	<li> T: If $\alpha \in PL$, where $PL$ stands for $I(A,P)$ for propositional logic, then $\alpha$ has the same number of left and right brackets
	<li> T: If $\alpha \in PL$, where $PL$ stands for $I(A,P)$ for propositional logic, then every proper initial segment of $\alpha$ has more left brackets than right brackets.
	<li> <b>Construction Tree:</b> Input: $\alpha$ Output: Decision wether WFF or not
		<li> 1. Check if $\alpha \in A$
		<li> 2. Check if it starts with a right bracket and ends with a left bracket else reject
		<li> 3. Remove left bracket if the next symbol is $\neg$ i.e. (\neg \beta) then copy $\beta$, go to step 1. setting $\alpha = \beta$ else got to 4.
		<li> 4. (Notice, a left bracket has been removed) Parse the expression from left till the number of right and left brackets is equal, remove the last left bracket.
			Split and got to step 1, for each of the branches.
<P>
	Why is a construction Tree a proof of WFF? A CS can be constructed  by ordering the Construction tree from bottom up with respect to the levels.
